        * Tackled text classification challenges by employing machine and deep learning methods, including **TF-IDF**, **SVMs**, **RNNs**, **CNNs**, and **Transformers**, for dialect identification in support of a multi-dialect translation system.
        * Enhanced the dialect identification system's accuracy by **3%** through the introduction of a novel model architecture for the Arabic language, utilizing RNNs and word embeddings.
        * Assessed various word embedding techniques such as **Word2Vec** and **FastText**, and visualized their effectiveness for Arabic words using the **t-SNE** dimensionality reduction algorithm.
        * Initiated a noise-cleaning project aimed at automatically removing noise from **Bixby** audio segments and identifying suitable samples for use as training data by the end of the internship.
