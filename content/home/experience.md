  - title: Software Development Engineer
    company: Amazon
    company_url: 'https://amazon.com'
    location: 'Amman, Jordan'
    date_start: '2019-10-30'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        * Developed multiple data pipelines that handle terabytes of data to provide daily training/inferencing ready builds.
        * Worked on developing Arabic and RTL supported systems either in the engineering part or by developing machine learning based solutions to do language identification and machine translation.
        * Participated in the design and the development of multiple search systems/experiments that support production traffic for multiple marketplaces.
        
  - title: Research Assistant
    company: Jordan University of Science and Technology
    company_url: 'http://www.just.edu.jo'
    location: 'Irbid, Jordan'
    date_start: '2019-05-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        * Worked on natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification like Semantic Text Similarity (STS), token labeling like Arabic Text Diacritization (ADT) and sequence-to-sequence problems like neural machine translation (NMT).
        * Participated in machine learning competitions such as [NSURL Semantic Question Similarity](https://ai.mawdoo3.com/nsurl-2019-task8) in Arabic **(2<sup>nd</sup>/10)**, [WANLP MADAR](https://sites.google.com/view/wanlp-2019/home) task **(4<sup>th</sup>/19)**, [SemEval ComVE](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21080) task **(3<sup>rd</sup>/17)**.
        * Organized multiple machine learning competitions like [AI-SOCO](https://sites.google.com/view/ai-soco-2020) at [FIRE](http://fire.irsi.res.in/fire/2020/home) and [ArEnMulti30K](https://sites.google.com/view/arenmulti30k) at [WAT](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/WAT/WAT2021).
        * Published multiple research papers in various conferences.
        
  - title: Machine Learning Engineer Intern
    company: Samsung Electronics
    company_url: ''
    location: 'Amman, Jordan'
    date_start: '2019-02-03'
    date_end: '2019-05-01'

        * I worked on text classification problems using machine and deep learning techniques like **TF-IDF**, **SVMs**, **RNNs**, **CNNs**, and **Transformers** to do dialects identification that supports multi-dialect translation system.
        * The newly developed dialects identification system increased accuracy by **3%** by proposing a new model architecture for Arabic language using RNNs and word embeddings.
        * Evaluated different word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec and FastText, and visualize them using **t-SNE** dimensionality reduction algorithm to find the best embeddings to use with Arabic words.
        * At the end of the internship, I initiated the noise-cleaning project that aims to automatically clean the noises from **Bixby** audio segments and classify the potential ones to be used as training data.
        
  - title: Freelance Trainer
    company: Hsoub
    company_url: 'https://www.hsoub.com'

        * Recorded videos for three different courses that explain how to use **Ruby on Rails** framework to build real-life applications.
        * The first course was about the basics of Ruby on Rails and how to build a simple Content Management System (CMS) application.
        * Next, I developed a course about using Ruby on Rails framework to build a forum like [HsoubIO](https://io.hsoub.com) (Similar to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)).
        * The last course was about scaling Ruby on Rails framework to build big projects like [Twitter](https://twitter.com).
        * The courses are available through [Hsoub Academy](https://academy.hsoub.com).
