I am a machine learning engineer at Amazon, working on the search domain. Beyond my professional role, I am passionate about researching natural language processing (NLP) for the Arabic language, such as diacritization, as well as investigating source code-related issues such as author identification and generation. Simultaneously, I am involved in numerous open-source initiatives, aimed at expanding my software engineering knowledge and offering valuable resources for Muslims and Arabic speakers. Additionally, I maintain a modest YouTube presence where I educate viewers on problem-solving, fundamental machine learning concepts, and other subjects through my channel, {{< staticref "https://www.youtube.com/yags" "newtab" >}}YAGs{{< /staticref >}}.
