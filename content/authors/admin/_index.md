I am a software development engineer at Amazon. I am interested in machine learning research, specially, natural language processing (NLP) for Arabic language and source code related problems. In parallel, I am working on multiple small open-source projects to learn more about software engineering. Also, I am a Youtuber (A small one), I am teaching problem solving, basic machine learning and other topics on my channel, {{< staticref "https://www.youtube.com/yags" "newtab" >}}YAGs{{< /staticref >}}.
